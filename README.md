# Background
Hirers can use Role Requirements, a product facilitating candidate screening during job ad creation. The system suggests up to 5 role requirement questions generated by AI algorithms, continually optimized for better outcomes.

A new Role Requirements recommendation engine has been developed, and the team is conducting an experiment (id = AU-1rr-A/B) to assess its impact on key metrics. The experiment, initiated on June 21st, is anticipated to run for several weeks. 

## Primary Metrics:
### Role Requirements adoption rate 
(indicating the selection of at least one question)

### Average number of questions selected.' 
The analysis is performed at the job level.

## Objective:
Preliminary analysis to provide insights into the ongoing experiment (challenger 'B' vs. champion 'A') involving the new Role Requirements recommendation engine.

# Understanding the Data Set

Combined filtered table:

Recommendation engine displayed questions and order: As displayed in the table

Selected Questions by hirer: Pre-employment Criteria, Work Availability

# Data Wrangling

<img width="857" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Winxent/-Case-Study-Role-Requirements-Recommendation-Engine-Analysis/assets/146320825/0bc71536-6bb1-43d0-911c-95066d55754d">

## 1. Inconsistent data entry
* Selected_order should only be populated when is_selected is 1
* Is_selected is 1, but there is no selected_order

<img width="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Winxent/-Case-Study-Role-Requirements-Recommendation-Engine-Analysis/assets/146320825/73f7c9a1-bc27-4d96-b986-7d58f72dfcd1">

SQL:

UPDATE `CaseStudy.data_combined`
SET is_selected = 0
WHERE selected_order IS NULL;

UPDATE `CaseStudy.data_combined`
SET is_selected = 1
WHERE selected_order IS NOT NULL;

## 2. Removing Irrelevant column

* question_version: not a key factor in your analysis.
* question_algorithm_id: Not focusing on the specific algorithms recommending questions.
* job_mode: Which the job ad was new or copy is not crucial for analysis.
* country: only one country

ALTER TABLE `CaseStudy.data_role_rec`
DROP COLUMN question_version,
DROP COLUMN question_algorithm_id,
DROP COLUMN job_mode,
DROP COLUMN country;

## 3. Combine the tables and create a new table, removing data that are not in the experiment

SELECT * FROM
casestudy.data_role_rec r
JOIN casestudy.data_experiment e
ON r.job_id=e.job_id;

## 4. Creating additional table for num_questions_selected

Assist in Data Visualisation in Tableau
Assist in calculating Average number of questions

SELECT
job_id,
SUM(is_selected) AS num_questions_selected
FROM CaseStudy.data_combined
GROUP BY job_id
HAVING num_questions_selected > 0
