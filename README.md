# Background
Hirers can use Role Requirements, a product facilitating candidate screening during job ad creation. The system suggests up to 5 role requirement questions generated by AI algorithms, continually optimized for better outcomes.

A new Role Requirements recommendation engine has been developed, and the team is conducting an experiment (id = AU-1rr-A/B) to assess its impact on key metrics. The experiment, initiated on June 21st, is anticipated to run for several weeks. 

## Primary Metrics:
### Role Requirements adoption rate 
(indicating the selection of at least one question)

### Average number of questions selected.' 
The analysis is performed at the job level.

## Objective:
Preliminary analysis to provide insights into the ongoing experiment (challenger 'B' vs. champion 'A') involving the new Role Requirements recommendation engine.
